v45 is a web theme designed using SVG to replace HTML contents with SVG tags. This will deliver all scalable vector imaging power to the web.<br><br>
During this version I'll try to demonstrate the ability of SVG to do basic web interface functions like showing a menu and page contents and navigate between pages using AJAX.<br><br>
The animations and transitions are pretty basic and will be made dynamic in following versions.
